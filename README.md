One file containing two classes:

Class ValidationMethods
- contains the functions which validate form data


Class TestValidationMethods
- tests the functions which validate form data

To run the tests you need to have PHPUnit installed on your Ubuntu.
At the command line, in the directory containing your test file, type "phpunit TestValidationMethods.php" to run the tests.

Ex.

  All 3 tests passed in this case.
