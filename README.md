Sooo this code could be run on your own device if you wanted but you would have to configure your project space to look like mine and then change the namespace and path in the code itself to be your namespace and path.
Anyways it works and is way more organized than the old code, and more close to how the real code on the WordPress site looks.
We have 31 unit tests being done at the moment.
